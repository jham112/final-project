Week 1

This week, I created the html with the select menu and the html for the KBBQ page. I created the base html for the rest of the pages but I have not edited them yet with the corresponding pictures and text. I focused on the second html and testing the swiping function. I wanted to make sure this first html worked before moving onto the rest of the food categories.

I'm currently editing the photos to be compatible with mobile. It took me a while to test the swipe on my phone due to uploading the webpage on Filezilla each time. I'm also testing the photo sizes. Looking at examples of other websites, I want the photos to be zoomed in when vertical and full size when horizontal. I'm still testing the most compatible dimensions. For now, I have the images to be landscape with dimensions 1136x640 (the landscape dimensions of an iPhone 5). I have to test around with the CSS of it as well.

It took me a few days to compile the photos and restaurant information. I received permission and photos from the original photographers. I just have to finish resizing the images once I figure out the best dimensions for mobile. And then insert the rest of the photos into the html.

It took me a while but I was able to figure out how to link the html page to each corresponding text in the select menu. KBBQ page works successfully. 

I was able to get the swiping function to work on the desktop and mobile. I was also able to figure out how to add text and get it to swipe with the picture. These are the links I used to help me figure out the swipe:
http://idangero.us/swiper/ (I downloaded the swipe jquery from here)
http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/swipe-page/capetown.html

I'll have to finish the rest of the htmls, fix the sizing of the images, and complete final CSS.

When I have time, I want to create an opening screen when you first open the app/website. It would be a title screen saying the name of the app and a button to press to start. The button would lead to the select menu page.
