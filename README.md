Week 1:

This week, I created the html with the select menu and the html for the KBBQ page. I created the base html for the rest of the pages but I have not edited them yet with the corresponding pictures and text. I focused on the second html and testing the swiping function. I wanted to make sure this first html worked before moving onto the rest of the food categories.

I'm currently editing the photos to be compatible with mobile. It took me a while to test the swipe on my phone due to uploading the webpage on Filezilla each time. I'm also testing the photo sizes. Looking at examples of other websites, I want the photos to be zoomed in when vertical and full size when horizontal. I'm still testing the most compatible dimensions. For now, I have the images to be landscape with dimensions 1136x640 (the landscape dimensions of an iPhone 5). I have to test around with the CSS of it as well.

It took me a few days to compile the photos and restaurant information. I received permission and photos from the original photographers. I just have to finish resizing the images once I figure out the best dimensions for mobile. And then insert the rest of the photos into the html.

It took me a while but I was able to figure out how to link the html page to each corresponding text in the select menu. KBBQ page works successfully.

I was able to get the swiping function to work on the desktop and mobile. I was also able to figure out how to add text and get it to swipe with the picture. These are the links I used to help me figure out the swipe:
http://idangero.us/swiper/ (I downloaded the swipe jquery from here)
http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/swipe-page/capetown.html

I'll have to finish the rest of the htmls, fix the sizing of the images, and complete final CSS.

When I have time, I want to create an opening screen when you first open the app/website. It would be a title screen saying the name of the app and a button to press to start. The button would lead to the select menu page.


Week 2:

This week I added a bit of CSS to my app. I added some background color and fonts.

The  biggest challenge this week was getting my photos to resize on the mobile screen. Using the files Professor McAdams sent me, I based my resizing Javascript from her jQuery. The photos are able to be resized but only when they are clicked on. I'm trying to see if they can be resized on the mobile screen without being clicked on. I tried using the "load" function for the photos but that did not work. I am trying different ways for the photos to be resized but this code works the best. Should I have the pictures to be resized when clicked on or is there a way to adjust this Javascript code? I will keep trying but I will ask the professor in class on Tuesday.

I put the resizing jQuery file separate from the swiping Javascript because the swipe function seems to not work when the two are combined.

For this week, I have finished putting in all of the images and restaurant locations in the HTMLs.

Next week, I will finish the rest of the CSS so all of the pages look good. I will add a title screen HTML for the app. If I have time, I want to add a navigation bar so the user can move freely around different pages.
